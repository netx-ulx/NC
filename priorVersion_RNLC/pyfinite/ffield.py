This package contains the FField class designed to perform calculations
in finite fields of characteristic two.  The following docstrings provide
detailed information on various topics:

                    to use them.

  FElement.__doc__  Describes the FElement class and how to use it.

  fields_doc        Briefly describes what a finite field is and
                    establishes notation for further documentation.

  design_doc        Discusses the design of the FField class and attempts
                    to justify why certain decisions were made.

  license_doc       Describes the license and lack of warranty for
                    this code.

  testing_doc       Describes some tests to make sure the code is working
                    as well as some of the built in testing routines.

    The FField class implements a finite field calculator.  The

    Add
    Subtract
    Multiply
    Inverse
    Divide
    FindDegree

    ExtendedEuclid
    FullDivision
    ShowCoefficients
    ShowPolynomial
    GetRandomElement
    ConvertListToElement
    TestFullDivision
    TestInverse

    Most of these methods take integers or longs representing field
    elements as arguments and return integers representing the desired
    field elements as output.  See ffield.fields_doc for an explanation
    of the integer representation of field elements.

    Example of how to use the FField class:

>>> import ffield
>>> F = ffield.FField(5) # create the field GF(2^5)
>>> a = 7 # field elements are denoted as integers from 0 to 2^5-1
>>> b = 15
>>> F.ShowPolynomial(a) # show the polynomial representation of a
'x^2 + x^1 + 1'
>>> F.ShowPolynomial(b)
'x^3 + x^2 + x^1 + 1'
>>> c = F.Multiply(a,b) # multiply a and b modulo the field generator
>>> c
8
>>> F.ShowPolynomial(c)
'x^3'
>>> F.Multiply(c,F.Inverse(a)) == b # verify multiplication works
1
>>> F.Multiply(c,F.Inverse(b)) == a # verify multiplication works
1
>>> d = F.Divide(c,b) # since c = F.Multiply(a,b), d should give a
>>> d

Roughly speaking a finite field is a finite collection of elements
where most of the familiar rules of math work.  Specifically, you
can add, subtract, multiply, and divide elements of a field and
continue to get elements in the field.  This is useful because
computers usually store and send information in fixed size chunks.
Thus many useful algorithms can be described as elementary operations
(e.g. addition, subtract, multiplication, and division) of these chunks.

Currently this package only deals with fields of characteristic 2.  That
is all fields we consider have exactly 2^p elements for some integer p.
We denote such fields as GF(2^p) and work with the elements represented
as p-1 degree polynomials in the indeterminate x.  That is an element of
the field GF(2^p) looks something like

     f(x) = c_{p-1} x^{p-1} + c_{p-2} x^{p-2} + ... + c_0

where the coefficients c_i are in binary.

Addition is performed by simply adding coefficients of degree i
modulo 2.  For example, if we have two field elements f and v
represented as f(x) = x^2 + 1 and v(x) = x + 1 then s = f + v
is given by (x^2 + 1) + (x + 1) = x^2 + x.  Multiplication is
performed modulo a p degree generator polynomial g(x).
For example, if f and v are as in the above example, then s = s * v
is given by (x^2 + 1) + (x + 1) mod g(x).  Subtraction turns out
to be the same as addition for fields of characteristic 2.  Division
is defined as f / v = f * v^-1 where v^-1 is the multiplicative
inverse of v.  Multiplicative inverses in groups and fields
can be calculated using the extended Euclid algorithm.

Roughly speaking the intuition for why multiplication is
performed modulo g(x), is because we want to make sure s * v
returns an element in the field.  Elements of the field are
polynomials of degree p-1, but regular multiplication could
yield terms of degree greater than p-1.  Therefore we need a
rule for 'reducing' terms of degree p or greater back down
to terms of degree at most p-1.  The 'reduction rule' is
taking things modulo g(x).

For another way to think of
taking things modulo g(x) as a 'reduction rule', imagine
g(x) = x^7 + x + 1 and we want to take some polynomial,
f(x) = x^8 + x^3 + x, modulo g(x).  We can think of g(x)
as telling us that we can replace every occurence of
x^7 with x + 1.  Thus f(x) becomes x * x^7 + x^3 + x which
becomes x * (x + 1) + x^3 + x = x^3 + x^2 .  Essentially, taking
polynomials mod x^7 by replacing all x^7 terms with x + 1 will
force down the degree of f(x) until it is below 7 (the leading power
of g(x).  See a book on abstract algebra for more details.

The FField class implements a finite field calculator for fields of
characteristic two.  This uses a representation of field elements
as integers and has various methods to calculate the result of
adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc. field elements
represented AS INTEGERS OR LONGS.

The FElement class provides objects which act like a new kind of
numeric type (i.e. they overload the +,-,*,%,//,/ operators, and
print themselves as polynomials instead of integers).

Use the FField class for efficient storage and calculation.
Use the FElement class if you want to play around with finite
field math the way you would in something like Matlab or
Mathematica.

                           WHY PYTHON?

You may wonder why a finite field calculator written in Python would
be useful considering all the C/C++/Java code already written to do
the same thing (and probably faster too).  The goals of this project
are as follows, please keep them in mind if you make changes:

o  Provide an easy to understand implementation of field operations.
   Python lends itself well to comments and documentation.  Hence,
   we hope that in addition to being useful by itself, this project
   will make it easier for people to implement finite field
   computations in other languages.  If you've ever looked at some
   of the highly optimized finite field code written in C, you will
   understand the need for a clear reference implementation of such
   operations.

o  Provide easy access to a finite field calculator.
   Since you can just start up the Python interpreter and do
   computations, a finite field calculator in Python lets you try
   things out, check your work for other algorithms, etc.
   Furthermore since a wealth of numerical packages exist for python,
   you can easily write simulations or algorithms which draw upon
   such routines with finite fields.

o  Provide a platform independent framework for coding in Python.
   Many useful error control codes can be implemented based on
   finite fields.  Some examples include error/erasure correction,
   cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs), and secret sharing.  Since
   Python has a number of other useful Internet features being able
   to implement these kinds of codes makes Python a better framework
   for network programming.

o  Leverages Python arbitrary precision code for large fields.
   If you want to do computations over very large fields, for example
   GF(2^p) with p > 31 you have to write lots of ugly bit field
   code in most languages.  Since Python has built in support for
   arbitrary precision integers, you can make this code work for
   arbitrary field sizes provided you operate on longs instead of
   ints.  In python 3 this is automatic, but in python2 you need
   to give as input numbers like 0L, 1L, 1L << 55, etc. to force
   using longs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                            BASIC DESIGN


The basic idea is to index entries in the finite field of interest
using integers and design the class methods to work properly on this
representation.  Using integers is efficient since integers are easy
to store and manipulate and allows us to handle arbitrary field sizes
without changing the code if we instead switch to using longs.

Specifically, an integer represents a bit string

  c = c_{p-1} c_{p-2} ... c_0.

which we interpret as the coefficients of a polynomial representing a
field element

  f(x) = c_{p-1} x^{p-1} + c_{p-2} x^{p-2} + ... + c_0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                             FUTURE
In the future, support for fields of other
characteristic may be added (if people want them).  Since computers
have built in parallelized operations for fields of characteristic
two (i.e. bitwise and, or, xor, etc.), this implementation uses
such operations to make most of the computations efficient.
